# localMPfinder
Web app to enter your postcode, and find your concordant federal electorate, and where your local member stands on an issue.

The app will search postcodes.csv for a postcode, and return the electorate.
The second function will search electorates.csv for the returned electorate name, and tell the user what their local member thinks about same sex marriage.

The project is published and updated regularly here:

This file is not styled, as I'm not prepared to share SBS News styles (they're not mine).
